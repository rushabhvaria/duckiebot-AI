# Project 2: Probabilistic Inference

Due Date: Monday, February 3, 2020 @ 11:59 P.M.

Student Name: Rushabh Varia

In this project, you will be implementing code to perform probabilistic inference in a grid world. You will also be asked to answer some open-ended questions as well. The submission details are provided at the end of the page.

### Instruction
For this project, you'll be using Google colab, which is a Jupyter Notebook hosted on Google Drive. If you've used Jupyter Notebook before, it'll feel familiar to you. If not, feel free to watch this short introductory video: https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI 

In order to start working on the assignment, you would need to save a copy of this colab onto your Google Drive as this file is read-only. This can be done by going on the top left hand corner and selecting `File -> Save a copy in Drive...` It should automatically create a copy and store a local copy on your Google Drive. Now you can edit the file! If you're curious on where the file is stored, select `File -> Locate in Drive`

Your job is to implement the functions below. Don't change the function names or parameters as they need to be consistent with the autograders. Make sure the output types are consistent with the comments as well.

# Coding [50 Points]

In the coding section, you will be implementing functions to calculate certain probability functions, sampling from these functions, as well as performing Bayes Net Inference. Please go through this first code section carefully, with the imports and variables you will need. Also, please use `generate_random_float` to get a random float between 0 and 1.

This function will take in one of the actions in `[Left, Right, Up, Down]`, and return the probability of that action occurring.

This function will take in one of the states of the grid world and return the probability of the robot being in that state. You will be returning a `float` between 0 and 1 which is the probability of that action. A state is represented by $(i,j)$, where $i$ is the row number in the grid, between 0 and 9 and $j$ is the column number in the grid, between 0 and 9. You will be using the following grid world diagram to calculate the probability of a state. You should use a numpy array to represent the grid world. The origin of this grid world (0,0) is in the top left corner. $i$ increases as you go down in the grid, and $j$ increases as you go right in the grid.

We have provided some unit tests for you to run to make sure that your code is working properly. However, these are not the exact same unit tests we will be running to make sure your code works properly, so your performance on these unit tests doesn't equate to your final score. Make sure you add a screenshot of the results of the tests in the appropriate slide in the reflection.

**NOTE**: Please don't hard code solutions to pass these unit tests, as these won't be the exact same unit tests we will be running.
